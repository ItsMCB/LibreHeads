  <br/>
</p>


## Install

LibreHeads uses data generously made available by https://minecraft-heads.com/.
As of current, in order to use this plugin, it must be built from source.
The steps are as follows: clone the repo, use download.sh script to create a save of the Minecraft Heads API data, and build the jar using Gradle.

Note: This process is intentional to avoid potential API problems and respect the data's license.


This plugin depends on [VexelCore](https://github.com/ItsMCB/VexelCore). (Drop both plugin jars into your plugins folder.)

# Quick Start Guide

To be able to use `/skull` or `/head`, give yourself the `libreheads.skull.get` permission.

To search for heads, use `/skull [term]` or `/head [term]`.
